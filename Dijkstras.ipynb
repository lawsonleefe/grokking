    "This works for 'weighted graphs' where there is a cost element associated with taking a certain path. Whereas breath-first will find the fewest moves through the nodes, it won't necessarily find the optimal path. Think of a gridlocked motorway vs a diversion via 3 separate roads,\n",
    "\n",
    "We first start with a graph showing how things are connected and a cost table which keeps track of the least expensive way to get to a given node. We also have a parent table which maps the route we should take based on costs. Both the parent and cost tables are updated as we move through the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This will fail if we have any negative costs. For example, if these costs mapped money rather than time, a negative value could represent a refund on something."
