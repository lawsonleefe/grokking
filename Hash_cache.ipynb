    "As hash tables use an array for storage, we need to avoid instances where array gets completely full.\n",
    "When this happens, we have a collision and will start overwriting data as there are no spare slots in memory to allocate new data to.\n",
    "To get around this, we could start a linked list at each slot in memory but this will cause item retrieval time to reduce from O(1), constant time to O(n), linear time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see how full our hash table array is by calculting the 'load factor' as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    • No. of items in hash table / total number of slots\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we had the following array with 1 out of 3 slots filled:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [ , 15, ]\n",
    "    \n",
    "Here, our load factor is 0.333...\n",
    "\n",
    "When arrays approach a certain size, we need to increase the size of the array to ensure new items will continue to fit in without collisions. This is called 'resizing' and involves re-inserting all existing values into a new, larger array.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good rule of thumb is to resize when the load factor reached 0.7\n",
    "\n",
    "As for a hash-function that implements this and distributes items evenly rather than clumping them together, resulting in collisions, it's not something we'll really have to worry about as all languages have built in functions for this already. However, something like SHA could be used."
